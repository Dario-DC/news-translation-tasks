# Welcome to our Article Translation Workflow

## Hey there, awesome community!

Excited to have you on board for our localization mission! Here's a simple guide to get you started:

Please sign up through [this form](https://forms.gle/1w8umSbTF4JTPwyj9) if you have not already done so. This will enable us to send you an invitation to join the "news-translation-tasks" as a Collaborator. 

**Can't wait to have you officially join the team!**

### Pick Your Article

Once you're in as a Collaborator, it's time to choose which article you'd like to work on. Check out the list of available issues/articles and pick the one that speaks to you.

### Claim Your Article

Found the perfect piece to translate? Awesome! Comment on the issue or article saying, "Assign this article to me." We'll then assign it to you, and you'll be all set to work your magic.

### Ready for Review: 

After you've translated your piece, give us a heads up by commenting, "Ready for Review." This will let our Language Leads or Proofreaders know that it's time to give your translation the once-over before potentially publishing it.

Easy peasy, right? We're stoked to have your help in bringing these articles and handbooks to new audiences around the world. 

**Let's get translating!**
